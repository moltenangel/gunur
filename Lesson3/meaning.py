# Lesson 3 - Operators
# Timestamp: 29:58


# Symbols used to perform operations on values and the variables that hold those values.
# = assignment
# + add
# - subtract
# * multiply
# / divide
# // divide (round down)
# round(expression) (round up)
# ** to the power of (exponent)
# % Modulus (remainder)
# += add
# -= subtract
# /= (converts to float)
# Comparison statements:
# + concatenate "string " + "string" = "string string"
# Is this equal (boolean) 42 == 41 = False
# Is not equal (boolean) 42 != 42 = False
# 10 > 5 = True
# x = True
# y = False
# Conditional Statements:
# not x = False
# and x and y = False because one of them is False
# or x or y = True  because one of them is True

meaning = 42
print('')
# if meaning > 10:
#     print('Right on!')
# else:
#     print('Not today')
# return

# Ternary Operator:
print('Right on!') if meaning > 10 else print('Not today')
